                    <p>During the Virtual Summer Retreat, your child will have the opportunity to connect with a diverse group of peers
                    and engage in discussions and project-based learning that will deepen their understanding of how experiences shape
                    peopleâ€™s perceptions of the world. These discussions and projects are designed to address the major upper elementary Common Core English Language Arts standards. Our goal is for students to be challenged intellectually while working 
                    together to solve problems, thereby providing authentic opportunities to exchange ideas and collaborate, in an effort
                    to dispel societal prejudices. </p>
