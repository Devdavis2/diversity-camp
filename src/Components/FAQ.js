        <b>When is the Virtual Summer Retreat?</b>
        <br />
        For Summer 2020, there are five possible sessions of the Virtual Summer
        Retreat. Each session lasts for 5 weekdays, with 2 hours of live
        classes/meetings each day.
        <br />
        <br /> The sessions are:
        <li>Session A: July 27-31 (2pm-4pm EST)</li>
        <li>Session B: August 3-7 (10am-12pm EST)</li>
        <li>Session C: August 3-7 (1pm-3pm EST)</li>
        <li>Session D: August 10-14 (10am-12pm EST)</li>
        <li>Session E: August 10-14 (1pm-3pm EST)</li>
        <br />
        <b>How much does the Virtual Summer Retreat cost? </b>
        <br />
        For the summer of 2020, the Virtual Summer Retreat is free to all
        participants.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>What materials will my child need?</b>
        <br />
        To participate in the Virtual Summer Retreat, your child just needs a
        reliable internet connection and a device they can use to access live
        Zoom classes for two hours daily throughout the week of the retreat. A
        laptop, desktop computer, Chromebook, or tablet are recommended, but
        your child could use an internet-enabled phone to participate in the
        retreat. <br />
        <br />
        Optional materials include:
        <li>headphones</li>
        <li>paper/notebook and pen/pencil to take notes</li> <br />
        After the Virtual Summer Retreat, participants will be provided with a
        book list for families who wish to purchase and reread any of the books
        we read during the retreat, as well as additional texts that may help
        children and their families continue discussions centered around
        diversity and inclusion.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>How old does my child need to be to participate?</b> <br />
        The books, activities, and discussions during the retreat will be most
        suitable for 9-11 year olds. However, if your child is between the ages
        of 6 and 14, we encourage you to still complete the questionnaire. If
        there is a high level of interest from parents of younger or older
        children, we may offer sessions that are adapted to meet the needs of
        younger or older students.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>How many children will attend each retreat? </b> <br />
        At this time, we are able to accept 12 students for each retreat
        session. This helps us to ensure that each child will have ample
        opportunities to participate in discussions with their peers and to work
        closely in a small group with an instructor.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Can more than one child from the same family participate? </b> <br />
        Yes! However, please remember that if multiple children are
        participating in the same session of the retreat, each child will need
        to have their own device to use to access the daily Zoom classes. This
        will allow each child to fully participate in discussions and
        individually use features on Zoom such as “chat” and “share screen.”
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Can parents and other family members participate too? </b> <br />
        Parents and other adult family members are welcome to be “off screen”
        participants by sitting next to their child during Zoom classes,
        listening to the discussions, helping to troubleshoot any technology
        issues, and supporting their child so that they feel comfortable and
        confident throughout the retreat.
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>How do I enroll my child?</b> <br />
        You can start by clicking <b>“apply here”</b> and completing the
        questionnaire. If we have space to accommodate your child this summer,
        we will send you a more thorough application form, which will help us
        learn more about your child’s interests, personality, and prior learning
        experiences.
