                <h1>Virtual Summer Retreat Overview</h1>
                    <p>During the Virtual Summer Retreat, your child will have the opportunity to connect with a diverse group of peers<br/>
                    and engage in discussions and project-based learning that will deepen their understanding of how experiences shape <br/>
                    peopleâ€™s perceptions of the world. These discussions and projects are designed to address the major upper elementary <br/>
                    Common Core English Language Arts standards. Our goal is for students to be challenged intellectually while working <br/>
                    together to solve problems, thereby providing authentic opportunities to exchange ideas and collaborate, in an effort <br/>
                    to dispel societal prejudices.
