        <p>
          During the Virtual Summer Retreat, your child will have the
          opportunity to connect with a diverse group of peers and engage in
          discussions and project-based learning that will deepen their
          understanding of how experiences shape people’s perceptions of the
          world. These discussions and projects are designed to address the
          major upper elementary{" "}
          <i>Common Core English Language Arts standards</i>. Our goal is for
          students to be challenged intellectually while working together to
          solve problems, thereby providing authentic opportunities to exchange
          ideas and collaborate, in an effort to dispel societal prejudices.{" "}
